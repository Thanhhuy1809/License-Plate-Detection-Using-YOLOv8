# License-Plate-Detection-Using-YOLOv8
A YOLOv8-based system for detecting vehicle license plates. The program resizes input images, performs inference using a trained model, and outputs bounding boxes highlighting detected plates.
This project focuses on applying the YOLOv8 deep-learning model to detect vehicle license plates in images. The system takes an input image, ensures that the dimensions match the model’s training requirements, performs inference, and outputs an annotated image containing bounding boxes around the detected license plates. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how modern object-detection models can be applied to real-world traffic-monitoring tasks, particularly in smart-city and intelligent transportation systems.

The repository includes the full dataset structure used for training, including folders for images and labels, along with a configuration file that defines class names and dataset paths. The project also contains Python scripts responsible for loading the YOLO model, preprocessing input images, performing inference, and saving the results. The output is a new image file where detected license plates are highlighted using bounding boxes.

This implementation provides a clear and practical example of using YOLOv8 for a specialized object-detection task. Users can easily adapt the project to other datasets, expand it into a full ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) system with OCR, or integrate it into real-time video processing pipelines. The structure of the repository is organized to be readable and beginner-friendly, making it suitable for learning purposes, research projects, or real-world development.
